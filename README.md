# ph-jaxws-pom

A POM only project that contains all dependencies for easily using JAX-WS from Maven.

Currently it is very tedious to include all artefacts relevant for JAX-WS into each and every POM manually.
Therefore I created this project to provide an easy to use POM for using JAX-WS from within Maven.

# Maven usage

Include it in your regular Maven dependencies but explicitly state the type **pom**:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger</groupId>
  <artifactId>ph-jaxws-pom</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Gradle usage (for issues up to v1.1.3)

As Gradle does not support Maven profile activation by JDK version, this section outlines the includes per JDK version (as of ph-jaxws-pom 1.1.0).

With JDK 8, include the following dependencies:
* org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-core:2.2.11
* org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:2.2.11
* com.sun.istack:istack-commons-runtime:2.21
* org.glassfish.jaxb:txw2:2.2.11
* com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-rt:2.2.10 excluding both com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-core and com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl
* com.sun.xml.ws:policy:2.4
* org.glassfish.gmbal:gmbal-api-only:3.1.0-b001
* com.sun.xml.stream.buffer:streambuffer:1.5.3
* org.glassfish.ha:ha-api:3.1.9
* org.jvnet.staxex:stax-ex:1.8.1

With JDK 9 or later, include the following dependencies:
* org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:2.3.2
* com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-rt:2.3.1

The exclusion of this POM might be necessary via `exclude group: 'com.helger', module: 'ph-jaxws-pom'`
